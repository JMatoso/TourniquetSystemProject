# Tourniquet System Project

Implementing a system with two read switches utilizing interrupt functions to simulate entrance and exit turnstiles, we aim to count the number of people entering and exiting a room, as well as track the current occupancy. On detecting any state changes, the updated data will be promptly transmitted to the PC.

### Hardware Components:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- 2 Switches (for entrance and exit simulation)
- 2 Pull-up resistors (470kâ„¦)
- 2 LEDs
- 5 Jumper wires
- Breadboard
